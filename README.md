# Time Series Analysis of Temperature and House Prices in the Midlands

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of my MSc Data Science coursework, focusing on time series analysis using ARIMA models. The study investigates:

- **Annual Temperature Trends (1900-2021)** in the Midlands region of England.
- **Monthly House Prices (2010-2020)** in the East Midlands, with forecasts for the first six months of 2020.

The analysis aims to uncover trends, stationarity, and optimal ARIMA models for forecasting.

## 📊 Data

The datasets used in this project are:

1. **Temperature Data:** Annual average temperature from 1900 to 2021.
2. **House Price Data:** Monthly average house prices from January 2010 to December 2019.

## 🛠️ Methodology

The following steps were carried out for both datasets:

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration

- Time series visualization.
- Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) analysis.

### 2️⃣ Stationarity Checks

- Analyzing trends and seasonality.
- Differencing the series to achieve stationarity.

### 3️⃣ Model Selection

- Evaluating different ARIMA and SARIMA models.
- Using AIC values and statistical hypothesis tests to select the best-fit model.

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation

- Residual analysis to check for white noise.
- Ljung-Box test for independence.

### 5️⃣ Forecasting

- Predicting future values with confidence intervals.

## 🔍 Key Results

### 📌 Temperature Analysis

- The best-fitting model was **ARIMA(0,1,1)**, capturing the increasing trend over time.
- The residuals indicated a good model fit with white noise properties.

### 📌 House Price Forecasting

- The best model was **ARIMA(1,1,2) × (0,1,1)[12]**, incorporating both trend and seasonality.
- Forecasts for 2020 show continued increase, with prediction intervals at 80% and 95% confidence levels.
